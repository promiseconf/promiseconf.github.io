<p><b>Abstract</b>: As a basic industrial research lab, Microsoft Research expects its members to both publish basic research and put it into practice.  Unfortunately, moving from a validated technique or model in a published paper to a state where that same technique is being used by and providing value to software development projects on a regular basis in a consistent and timely fashion is a time consuming, fraught, and difficult task. We have attempted to make this transition, which we call "Tech Transfer", many times in the empirical software engineering group (ESE) at Microsoft Research. Much like research in general, there have been both triumphs and setbacks, but each experience has provided valuable insight and informed our next effort. This talk shares our experiences from successes and failures and provides lessons and guidance that can be used by others trying to transfer their research into practice in both industrial and academic contexts.
</p>


<p><b>Biography</b>: Christian Bird is a principal researcher in the Empirical Software Engineering group at Microsoft Research.  He is primarily interested in the relationship between software design, social dynamics, and processes in large development projects and in developing tools and techniques to help software teams.  He uses both quantitative and qualitative methods to understand and improve areas including code review, software engineering management, and software productivity.  He has published in the top Software Engineering venues, has received multiple distinguished papers and test of time awards, and was recognized with the ACM SigSoft Early Career Award.  Christian received B.S. from Brigham Young University and his Ph.D. from the University of California, Davis.

    <h2>Call for papers</h2>
  <p>
  <img width=120 align=right style="padding: 5px;" src="img/cfp.png">
  <p> <b> Technical papers:</b> (10 pages) 
  PROMISE accepts a wide range of papers where AI tools have been applied to SE
  such as predictive modeling  and other AI methods.
  Both positive and negative results are
  welcome, though negative results should still be based on rigorous
  research and provide details on lessons learned. 
  <p> <b> Industrial papers:</b> (2-4 pages) Results, challenges, lessons learned
       from industrial applications of software analytics.
  <p> <b> New idea  papers:</b> (2-4 pages) Novel insights or ideas that may 
  yet to be fully tested. 
  
  <p> <b> Defect prediction challenge-track papers:</b> (2 pages).
	  For details on this challenge track, see the <a href="https://github.com/smartshark/promise-challenge/blob/main/CfP.md">challenge CFP</a>. In summary, we provide just-in-time defect prediction data, and you can submit any defect prediction approach of your choosing to participate in this challenge. The highest scoring approach wins. Note that such challenge track papers would be a suitable term project from university students.
	

  </ul>
  <h3> Publication and Attendance</h3>
  <img width=80 align=right style="padding: 5px;" src="img/acm.png">
  	<p>Accepted papers will be published in the main ACM publication program will be available electronically via ACM Digital
  	Library. 

  	<p>Each accepted paper needs to have one registration
  	at the full conference rate and be presented in person at
  	the conference.

   

  <h3>Green Open Access</h3>
  <p>
  Similar to other
  leading SE conferences, PROMISE supports and encourages Green Open
  Access, i.e., self-archiving. Authors can archive their papers on
  their personal home page, an institutional repository of their
  employer, or at an e-print server such as arXiv (preferred).
  Also, given that PROMISE papers heavily rely on software
  data, we would like to draw authors that leverage data scraped from
  GitHub of GitHub's Terms of Service, which require that "publications
  resulting from that research are open access". 
  <p>
  We also strongly encourage
  authors to submit their tools and data to <a href="https://zenodo.org/">Zenodo</a>,
  which adheres to FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and re-usable) principles
  and provides DOI versioning.

  			<div class="span6">

				<h2>Submissions</h2>
				PROMISE 2021 submissions must meet the following criteria:
				<ul>
					<li>be original work, not published or under review elsewhere while being considered;</li>
					<li>conform to the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template" target="_blank">ACM SIG proceedings template; </a></li>
					<li>not exceed 10 (4) pages for full (short) papers including references;</li>
					<li>be written in English;</li>
					<li>be prepared for <b>double blind</b> review, except for data papers, where double blind is optional (see instructions below);</li>
					<li>be submitted via <a href="https://promise21.hotcrp.com/" target="_blank">HotCRP </a>(please choose the paper category appropriately). </li>
					

				</ul>
				Submissions will be peer reviewed by at least three experts from the international program committee. Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of their originality, importance of contribution, soundness, evaluation, quality, and consistency of presentation, and appropriate comparison to related work. Accepted papers will be published in the main ACM publication program and will be available electronically via ACM Digital Library. Each accepted paper needs to have one registration at the full conference rate and be presented in person at the conference.
			</div>
		</div>

<br><hr>
				<h2>Double-Blind Review Process</h2>
				<p>PROMISE 2021 will employ a double-blind review process, except for data papers, where double blind is optional (see below). This means that the submissions should by no means disclose the identity of the authors. The authors must make every effort to honor the double-blind review process. In particular, the authors’ names must be omitted from the submission and references to their prior work should be in the third person.</p>

<p>If the paper is about a data set or data collection tool, double-blind review is not obligatory. However, authors may choose to opt in double blind reviews by making their data repository or data collection tool anonymous and omitting their paper authorship information if they wish to. If in doubt regarding the obligatoriness of double blind review for your specific case, please contact the PC chairs.</p><br>

				<p><b>Why double blind?</b></p>


				<p>Double blind has now taken off, mostly driven by the considerable number of requests from the software engineering community. We have also now decided to respond to this call. We are aware that there are certain challenges with regard to the double blind review process as detailed by Shepperd [1]. However, we hope that the benefits, some of which are discussed by Le Goues [2], will overcome those challenges.</p>
