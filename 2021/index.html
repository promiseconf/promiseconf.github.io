<p><b>Abstract</b>: Bugs are prevalent in software systems, and they are typically recorded in a variety of issue tracking systems. Needless to say, these bugs need to be resolved to improve software quality and increase customer satisfaction. Unfortunately, resolving them is not a trivial matter -- many remain unresolved for weeks (or even years!) and involve a complex multi-step process. Can AI help? Of course! AI can be trained on rich historical data to allow it to mimic developers in squashing bugs (and more!). For AI to work well, it often needs to be trained on a sizable amount of data. Fortunately, many projects maintain large historical data in various repositories that are publicly available, collectively forming big data of historically squashed bugs (that I like to refer to as "Big Fix"). Although full automation is not feasible yet (at least in the general sense), AI-infused solutions can support developers in their quest to squash bugs. This talk will provide an overview and reflection of the large body of work that builds automated tools (including predictive models) that leverage the power of AI, trained on rich data in issue repositories (and more!), for various tasks in the bug resolution process. Some open challenges and preliminary solutions will also be presented, with the goal of encouraging more research in this exciting area in the intersection of AI and Software Engineering.</p>

<p><b>Abstract</b>: All software development relies on open-source software (OSS) for platforms, components, and other artifacts. These critical OSS projects are typically outside developers' control, with their own priorities and practices. OSS grows incredibly fast, making it impossible to determine all the benefits and risks for the projects that rely on or want to exploit it. While there has been a tremendous progress in software prediction models ranging from ways to optimize distributed development to prediction of risky changes, all of them, however, are focused on one or a few projects. The recent developments of software data collection such as World of Code (WoC), where the entirety of OSS data is collected and curated, provide opportunities to model the extensive movement of artifacts, people, and ideas among projects in this giant ecosystem. While some of the project-focused models could be extended to the entirety of OSS, we discuss the entirely new set of models predicting the formation of social and technical networks, spread of technologies, and transfer of expertise. These models provide the most compelling opportunities to address emerging ecosystem-scale software engineering problems. The talk will also briefly introduce practical ways to get started developing ecosystem-scale prediction models.</p>


<p><b>Biography</b>: Audris Mockus received the BS and MS degrees in applied mathematics from the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology in 1988, the MS degree in 1991 and the PhD degree in statistics from Carnegie Mellon University in 1994. He is interested in recovering information and creating models of reality from big operational data. His latest interest concern models of the entire open source software ecosystem based on version control data and anthropological phenomena hidden in large image collections. He is the Ericsson-Harlan D. Mills Chair Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science of the University of Tennessee. Previously he worked at Avaya Research and AT&T and Lucent Bell Labs.

    <h2>Call for papers</h2>
  <p>
  <img width=120 align=right style="padding: 5px;" src="img/cfp.png">
  <p> <b> Technical papers:</b> (10 pages) 
  PROMISE accepts a wide range of papers where AI tools have been applied to SE
  such as predictive modeling  and other AI methods.
  Both positive and negative results are
  welcome, though negative results should still be based on rigorous
  research and provide details on lessons learned. 
  <p> <b> Industrial papers:</b> (2-4 pages) Results, challenges, lessons learned
       from industrial applications of software analytics.
  <p> <b> New idea  papers:</b> (2-4 pages) Novel insights or ideas that may 
  yet to be fully tested. 
  
  <p> <b> Defect prediction challenge-track papers:</b> (2 pages).
	  For details on this challenge track, see the <a href="https://github.com/smartshark/promise-challenge/blob/main/CfP.md">challenge CFP</a>. In summary, we provide just-in-time defect prediction data, and you can submit any defect prediction approach of your choosing to participate in this challenge. The highest scoring approach wins. Note that such challenge track papers would be a suitable term project from university students.
	

  </ul>
  <h3> Publication and Attendance</h3>
  <img width=80 align=right style="padding: 5px;" src="img/acm.png">
  	<p>Accepted papers will be published in the main ACM publication program and will be available electronically via ACM Digital
  	Library. 

  	<p>Each accepted paper needs to have one registration
  	at the full conference rate and be presented in person at
  	the conference.

   

  <h3>Green Open Access</h3>
  <p>
  Similar to other
  leading SE conferences, PROMISE supports and encourages Green Open
  Access, i.e., self-archiving. Authors can archive their papers on
  their personal home page, an institutional repository of their
  employer, or at an e-print server such as arXiv (preferred).
  Also, given that PROMISE papers heavily rely on software
  data, we would like to draw authors that leverage data scraped from
  GitHub of GitHub's Terms of Service, which require that "publications
  resulting from that research are open access". 
  <p>
  We also strongly encourage
  authors to submit their tools and data to <a href="https://zenodo.org/">Zenodo</a>,
  which adheres to FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and re-usable) principles
  and provides DOI versioning.

				<h2>Submissions</h2>
				PROMISE 2021 submissions must meet the following criteria:
				<ul>
					<li>be original work, not published or under review elsewhere while being considered;</li>
					<li>conform to the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template" target="_blank">ACM SIG proceedings template; </a></li>
					<li>not exceed 10 (4) pages for full (short) papers including references;</li>
					<li>be written in English;</li>
					<li>be prepared for <b>double blind</b> review, except for data papers, where double blind is optional (see instructions below);</li>
					<li>be submitted via <a href="https://promise21.hotcrp.com/" target="_blank">HotCRP </a>(please choose the paper category appropriately). </li>
					

				</ul>
				Submissions will be peer reviewed by at least three experts from the international program committee. Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of their originality, importance of contribution, soundness, evaluation, quality, and consistency of presentation, and appropriate comparison to related work. Accepted papers will be published in the main ACM publication program and will be available electronically via ACM Digital Library. Each accepted paper needs to have one registration at the full conference rate and be presented in person at the conference.

<br><hr>
				<h2>Double-Blind Review Process</h2>
				<p>PROMISE 2021 will employ a double-blind review process, except for data papers, where double blind is optional (see below). This means that the submissions should by no means disclose the identity of the authors. The authors must make every effort to honor the double-blind review process. In particular, the authors’ names must be omitted from the submission and references to their prior work should be in the third person.</p>

<p>If the paper is about a data set or data collection tool, double-blind review is not obligatory. However, authors may choose to opt in double blind reviews by making their data repository or data collection tool anonymous and omitting their paper authorship information if they wish to. If in doubt regarding the obligatoriness of double blind review for your specific case, please contact the PC chairs.</p><br>

				<p><b>Why double blind?</b></p>


				<p>Double blind has now taken off, mostly driven by the considerable number of requests from the software engineering community. We have also now decided to respond to this call. We are aware that there are certain challenges with regard to the double blind review process as detailed by Shepperd [1]. However, we hope that the benefits, some of which are discussed by Le Goues [2], will overcome those challenges.</p>
