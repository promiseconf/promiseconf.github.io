				<h2>Keynote by <a href="http://www.khomh.net" target="_blank">Dr. Foutse Khomh</a>, Polytechnique Montréal, Canada</h2>
				<p><b><font size="5">Harnessing Predictive Modeling and Software Analytics in the Age of LLM-Powered Software Development</font></b></p>
				<table>
					<tr><td><b>Abstract:</b> In the rapidly evolving landscape of software development, Large Language Models (LLM) have emerged as powerful tools that can significantly impact the way software code is written, reviewed, and optimized, making them invaluable resources for programmers. They offer developers the ability to leverage pre-trained knowledge and tap into vast code repositories, enabling faster development cycles and reducing the time spent on repetitive or mundane coding tasks. However, while these models offer substantial benefits, their adoption also presents multiple challenges. For example, they might generate code snippets that are syntactically correct but functionally flawed, requiring human review and validation. Moreover, the ethical considerations surrounding these models, such as biases in the training data, should be carefully addressed to ensure fair and inclusive software development practices. This talk will provide an overview and reflection on some of these challenges, present some preliminary solutions, and discuss opportunities for predictive models and data analytics.</td></tr>

					<h2>Call for papers</h2>
					<p>
						<img width=120 align=right style="padding: 5px;" src="img/cfp.png">
						<b>Technical papers:</b> (10 pages) 
						PROMISE accepts a wide range of papers where AI tools have been applied to SE such as predictive modeling  and other AI methods. Both positive and negative results are welcome, though negative results should still be based on rigorous research and provide details on lessons learned. 
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Industrial papers:</b> (2-4 pages)
						Results, challenges, lessons learned from industrial applications of software analytics.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>New idea  papers:</b> (2-4 pages)
						Novel insights or ideas that may yet to be fully tested. 
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Journal First:</b> <b>(*new this year*)</b>
						Selected papers will be invited for journal first presentations at PROMISE. Details to follow.
					</p>
					<h3> Publication and Attendance</h3>
					<p>
						<img width=80 align=right style="padding: 5px;" src="img/acm.png">
						Accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library within its International Conference Proceedings Series and will be available electronically via ACM Digital Library. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Each accepted paper needs to have one registration at the full conference rate and be presented in person at the conference.
					</p>
					<h3>Green Open Access</h3>
					<p>
						Similar to other leading SE conferences, PROMISE supports and encourages Green Open Access, i.e., self-archiving. Authors can archive their papers on their personal home page, an institutional repository of their employer, or at an e-print server such as arXiv (preferred). Also, given that PROMISE papers heavily rely on software data, we would like to draw authors that leverage data scraped from GitHub of GitHub's Terms of Service, which require that &quot;publications resulting from that research are open access&quot;. 
					</p>
					<p>
						We also strongly encourage authors to submit their tools and data to <a href="https://zenodo.org/">Zenodo</a>, which adheres to FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and re-usable) principles and provides DOI versioning.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="span1">

				<div class="span6">
					<h2>Submissions</h2>
					PROMISE 2024 submissions must meet the following criteria:

					</ul>
					To satisfy the double blind requirement submissions must meet the following criteria:
					<ul>
						<li>no author names and affiliations in the body and metadata of the submitted paper;</li>
						<li>self-citations are written in the third person;</li>
						<li>no references to the authors personal, lab, or university website;</li>
						<li>no references to personal accounts on GitHub, bitbucket, Google Drive, etc.</li>

			<!--<h2>Double-Blind Review Process</h2>
			<p>
				PROMISE 2022 will employ a double-blind review process, except for data papers, where double blind is optional (see below). This means that the submissions should by no means disclose the identity of the authors. The authors must make every effort to honor the double-blind review process. In particular, the authors’ names must be omitted from the submission and references to their prior work should be in the third person.
			</p>

			<p>
				If the paper is about a data set or data collection tool, double-blind review is not obligatory. However, authors may choose to opt in double blind reviews by making their data repository or data collection tool anonymous and omitting their paper authorship information if they wish to. If in doubt regarding the obligatoriness of double blind review for your specific case, please contact the PC chairs.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Why double blind?</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				Double blind has now taken off, mostly driven by the considerable number of requests from the software engineering community. We have also now decided to respond to this call. We are aware that there are certain challenges with regard to the double blind review process as detailed by Shepperd [1]. However, we hope that the benefits, some of which are discussed by Le Goues [2], will overcome those challenges.
