<p><b><a name="bellamy">Dr. Rachel Bellamy: Fair AI in Practice</a></b>.
Fairness is an increasingly important concern as machine learning
models are used to support decision making in high-stakes applications
such as mortgage lending, hiring, and prison sentencing. This talk
will introduce an open source Python toolkit for algorithmic fairness,
AI Fairness 360 (AIF360). The main objectives of this toolkit are
to help facilitate the transition of fairness research algorithms
to use in an industrial setting and to provide a common framework
for fairness researchers to share and evaluate algorithms.
<em>
Dr. Bellamy is a Principle Research Scientist and Chair of the Exploratory Computer Sciences Council at IBM T J Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, New York. 
Previously she led the IBM Research Human-AI Collaboration group. This group researches user experience for several of IBM's AI projects, i
including the AI Fairness 360 toolkit and rule-based machine-teaching for Watson Assistant. Rachel received her doctorate in cognitive 
psychology from University of Cambridge, UK in 1991. She holds many patents and has published more than 70 research papers.

<p><b><a name="briand">Dr. Lionel Briand: AI in SE: a 25-year Journey</a></b>
There is a long history of applications of various Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies in software engineering. From machine learning, evolutionary computing, to Natural Language Processing, AI has played an increasingly important role in making software engineering more predictable and automatable. This rising impact stems from increasingly powerful AI technologies, easy access to enormous computing power, and the availability of large amounts of software data in readily available development repositories.
This talk will provide a reflection over 25 years of experience in applying and tailoring AI techniques to address software engineering problems at scale. I will try to abstract away and identify patterns of hard software engineering problems requiring solutions based on AI. Challenges will be characterized and interdisciplinary research avenues will be outlined.
<em>
 Lionel C. Briand is professor of software engineering and has
 shared appointments between (1) The University of Ottawa, Canada
 and (2) The SnT centre for Security, Reliability, and Trust,
 University of Luxembourg. One of the founders of
 the 
 ICST conference 
was also EiC of Empirical Software
 Engineering (Springer) for 13 years.
 Lionel was elevated to the grade of IEEE Fellow in 2010 for his
 work on testing object-oriented systems. He received an ERC
 Advanced grant in 2016- on the topic of modelling and testing
 cyber-physical systems- which is the most prestigious individual
 research award in the European Union. Most recently, he was awarded
 a Canada Research Chair (Tier 1) on "Intelligent Software Dependability
 and Compliance". His research interests include: software testing
 and verification, model-driven software development, applications
 of AI in software engineering, and empirical software engineering.

<p>
<b>Inventing the next generation of software analytics.</b>

<p>Following on from this conference, we are organizing a 
special issue of the Empirical Software Engineering Journal.
<p>We
will ask authors
to comment on the success and failings of software analytics
over the last 20 years and will ask
"what and how can we do it better in future?". It is encouraged,
but not mandatory that authors 
explore the ethical issues raised in our CFP.

<p>The special issue will have the same guest editors as the co-PC chairs
of this conferences. Where possible, that special issue will also try to
use the same reviewers as PROMISE'20. The special issue will be open to
the entire SE community.

<p>Note that any PROMISE conference paper submitted to the special issue must be a 
significant extension to original conference content.

			  <h3>Covid-19 notice</h3> <p>Due to covid-19, PROMISE'20 will be a fully virtual event, co-located with FSE. Further information will follow soon.</p><hr>
			  
			  
<p>  
For decades, 
<a href="#history">PROMISE has lead the SE field in open science</a>.
Here, we place a high premium on work
that can be repeated and/or improved and/or refuted by other researchers.
Hence we focus on those conclusions that can be reached automatically, via data mining.
Also, we strongly suggest that PROMISE authors share their
tools and data.  
<!-- p>
Our  theme for PROMISE'20 is  <u>Ethical AI</u>.  
Models generated by AI-for-SE tools 
are 
assessed  by their predictive performance (via accuracy, recall, etc).
But groups like
the
IEEE, the Europeran Union, and Microsoft
now demand we
<a href="#ethics">assess
our tools using other
ethical criteria</a>. Hence, 
PROMISE'20 asks:
<ul><em>
Can we now apply and adjust our AI-for-SE tools (including predictive models)
to handle ethical non-functional requirements such as
inclusiveness, transparency, oversight and accountability,
privacy, security, reliability, safety, diversity and fairness? 
</em></ul>
<p>
To support our PROMISE'20 theme on Ethical AI:
<ul>
<li>We ask PROMISE'20 authors
to offer one (or more) section(s) in their paper on how their technology comments on ethical
non-functional requirements. 
For more details on thse kinds of requirements, see 
<a href="#ethics">notes on ethics</a>, below.
<span style="background-color: #ADFF2F;">This request is optional: PROMISE'20 is also 
	a venue for 
T
"classic" PROMISE research that explores predictive modeling</span>.
	<li> We have invited keynote speakers to address
these broader issues of AI-for-SE tools. 
<li> We are planning a lively "fish-bowl panel"
for this meeting where all participants can comment on ethics and AI-for-SE. </p -->

<p> This meeting will be followed by a <a href="#special">special issue of the Empirical Software Engineering journal</a>,
focusing on the issues of this conference.

<h3>Green Open Access</h3>
<p>
Similar to other
leading SE conferences, PROMISE supports and encourages Green Open
Access, i.e., self-archiving. Authors can archive their papers on
their personal home page, an institutional repository of their
employer, or at an e-print server such as arXiv (preferred).
Also, given that PROMISE papers heavily rely on software
data, we would like to draw authors that leverage data scraped from
GitHub of GitHub's Terms of Service, which require that "publications
resulting from that research are open access". 
<p>
We also strongly encourage
authors to submit their tools and data to <a href="https://zenodo.org/">Zenodo</a>,
which adheres to FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and re-usable) principles
and provides DOI versioning.

<a name=history><h3>History</h3></a>
<p>
<img align=right width=300 style="padding: 5px;" src="https://github.com/promiseconf/promiseconf.github.io/raw/master/2020/img/history.png">
In this era of Github, GHtorrent, et al. it is hard to recall that
only a decade ago, it was difficult to access project data.
Nevertheless, that was the case.
<p>
Back in 2005 many people in the MSR field were analyzing large
amount of (public) open source data but kept the tools and processed
datasets to themselves as it was often considered a competitive
advantage. In fact, within the MSR community, it was not until 2013
that they started their Data Showcase track to encourage sharing
of data.
<p>
Meanwhile, back in 2005, the PROMISE CFP made such sharing an
explicit requirements when, in all caps, that document said:
<ul><em>
"SUBMISSIONS WHICH INCLUDE EMPIRICAL RESULTS BASED ON PUBLICLY
ACCESSIBLE DATASETS WILL BE GIVEN THE HIGHEST PRIORITY"
</em>
</ul>
<p> That emphasis of shared and
repeatable results was unthinkable at that time and many people
predicted that PROMISE would not last long. Tee hee. They were wrong.

<p>And here are some recent quotes from leading figures in SE about 
what was achieved by those PROMISE meetings:
<ul>
<li>
"I don't think any other contribution that is even remotely comparable
to (PROMISE)." 
<li>
"There are many factors that lead to the state-of-the-art
in mining software repositories, ... sharing and replicability in
the science of software engineering, but in my opinion, none played
a greater role than PROMISE."
<li>
"I can't think of a stronger contribution right now (to MSR), except
maybe the creation of the MSR community by Dr. Hassan." 
<li>
"PROMISE
makes research results reproducible. For example, according to
Robles et al. at MSR 2010, they found that over 95% of 171 papers
published at MSR were unreproducible, since their associated data
was no longer on-line. However, nearly all of the papers at the
PROMISE conference was reproducible since they were based on PROMISE
data. I believe this is a really significant contribution. "
