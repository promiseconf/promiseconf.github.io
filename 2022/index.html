			<!-- Call for Papers and Submissions Block -->

					<h2>Call for papers</h2>
					<p>
						<img width=120 align=right style="padding: 5px;" src="img/cfp.png">
						<b>Technical papers:</b> (10 pages) 
						PROMISE accepts a wide range of papers where AI tools have been applied to SE such as predictive modeling  and other AI methods. Both positive and negative results are welcome, though negative results should still be based on rigorous research and provide details on lessons learned. 
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Industrial papers:</b> (2-4 pages)
						Results, challenges, lessons learned from industrial applications of software analytics.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>New idea  papers:</b> (2-4 pages)
						Novel insights or ideas that may yet to be fully tested. 
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Tutorials/Technical Briefing:</b> (2+1 pages) <b>(*new this year*)</b>
						Tutorials and short technical briefings on trending topics related to software engineering (duration: 60/90/120 minutes). The proposal should be no longer than 2 pages plus one page for brief speaker information and biographies.
					</p>
					<h3> Publication and Attendance</h3>
					<p>
						<img width=80 align=right style="padding: 5px;" src="img/acm.png">
						Accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library within its International Conference Proceedings Series and will be available electronically via ACM Digital Library. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Each accepted paper needs to have one registration at the full conference rate and be presented in person at the conference.
					</p>
					<h3>Green Open Access</h3>
					<p>
						Similar to other leading SE conferences, PROMISE supports and encourages Green Open Access, i.e., self-archiving. Authors can archive their papers on their personal home page, an institutional repository of their employer, or at an e-print server such as arXiv (preferred). Also, given that PROMISE papers heavily rely on software data, we would like to draw authors that leverage data scraped from GitHub of GitHub's Terms of Service, which require that &quot;publications resulting from that research are open access&quot;. 
					</p>
					<p>
						We also strongly encourage authors to submit their tools and data to <a href="https://zenodo.org/">Zenodo</a>, which adheres to FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and re-usable) principles and provides DOI versioning.
					</p>

					<h2>Submissions</h2>
					PROMISE 2022 submissions must meet the following criteria:
					<ul>
						<li>be original work, not published or under review elsewhere while being considered;</li>
						<li>conform to the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template" target="_blank">ACM SIG proceedings template; </a></li>
						<li>not exceed 10 (4) pages for technical (industrial, new-ideas) papers including references;</li>
						<li>be written in English;</li>
						<li>be prepared for <b>double blind review</b>
							<ul><li>Exception: for data-oriented papers, authors may elect not to use double blind by placing a footnote on page 1 saying &quot;Offered for single-blind review&quot;.</li></ul>
						</li>
						<li>be submitted via <a href="https://promise22.hotcrp.com/" target="_blank">HotCRP</a>;</li>
						<li>on submission, please choose the paper category appropriately, i.e., technical (main track, 10 pages max); industrial (4 pages max); and new idea papers (4 pages max).</li>
					</ul>
					To satisfy the double blind requirement submissions must meet the following criteria:
					<ul>
						<li>no author names and affiliations in the body and metadata of the submitted paper;</li>
						<li>self-citations are written in the third person;</li>
						<li>no references to the authors personal, lab, or university website;</li>
						<li>no references to personal accounts on GitHub, bitbucket, Google Drive, etc.</li>
					</ul>
					Submissions will be peer reviewed by at least three experts from the international program committee. Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of their originality, importance of contribution, soundness, evaluation, quality, and consistency of presentation, and appropriate comparison to related work.

			<!--<h2>Double-Blind Review Process</h2>
			<p>
				PROMISE 2022 will employ a double-blind review process, except for data papers, where double blind is optional (see below). This means that the submissions should by no means disclose the identity of the authors. The authors must make every effort to honor the double-blind review process. In particular, the authors’ names must be omitted from the submission and references to their prior work should be in the third person.
			</p>

			<p>
				If the paper is about a data set or data collection tool, double-blind review is not obligatory. However, authors may choose to opt in double blind reviews by making their data repository or data collection tool anonymous and omitting their paper authorship information if they wish to. If in doubt regarding the obligatoriness of double blind review for your specific case, please contact the PC chairs.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Why double blind?</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				Double blind has now taken off, mostly driven by the considerable number of requests from the software engineering community. We have also now decided to respond to this call. We are aware that there are certain challenges with regard to the double blind review process as detailed by Shepperd [1]. However, we hope that the benefits, some of which are discussed by Le Goues [2], will overcome those challenges.
