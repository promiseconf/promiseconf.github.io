				<h2>Call for papers</h2>
				<p>
					We invite two types of proposals on topics related to the PROMISE community:
					<ul>
						<li>Short Technical Briefings: Speakers provide a focused introduction to an emerging topic in software engineering (e.g., software engineering practices for specific types of prediction technologies). Duration: 60 minutes.</li>
						<li>Tutorials: Speakers organize a session introducing a software engineering activity, or a method, technique, dataset on a topic with hands-on participation of attendees. A tutorial may describe a software engineering activity, such as the state-of-the-art in program analysis, or it may describe a method, technique, framework, benchmark used in software engineering (research and/or practice). Duration: 90 or 120 minutes with a potential scope for hands-on participation. </li>
					</ul>
					Potential presenters should keep in mind that there may be quite a varied audience, including novice graduate students, seasoned practitioners, and specialized researchers. They should be prepared to cope with this diversity unless they make clear that the tutorial is oriented to a particular subgroup. Also bear in mind that not everyone will have English as their first language. Thus, presenters should provide comprehensive notes written in clear, standard English. Idioms, irony, slang, and culture-specific references should be avoided.

				<h2>Important Dates</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Submissions due: August 1st, 2022</li>
					<li>Author notification: August 19th, 2022</li>
					<li>Conference Date: November 17th, 2022</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>How to submit</h2>
				<p>

				<h2>Tutorial Proposal Guidelines</h2>
				<p>
					Proposal submissions should follow this structure:
					<ul>
						<li>Title of the tutorial or technical briefing</li>
						<li>Type: Tutorial-90/120 mins / Technical Briefing</li>
						<li>Name, affiliation, email address, website (if any) of the presenter(s)</li>
						<li>Abstract (max 300 words), suitable for posting on the conference web site</li>
						<li>Tutorial aims and objectives</li>
						<li>Intended audience and required background</li>
						<li>Relevance: justification of why the topic would be of interest to a broad section of the PROMISE community.</li>
						<li>Format: lecture, hands-on session, group activity, etc.</li>
						<li>Outline of the topics covered by the tutorial, with approximate timing</li>
						<li>Key learning objectives for the participants</li>
						<li>Audio-visual and technical requirements</li>
						<li>Presenterâ€™s bio: 250-word bio of the presenter(s), stressing their qualification with respect to the tutorial topic, and any previous experience of delivering tutorials</li>
					</ul>
					The proposal should be no longer than 2 pages + 1 page bio and must conform to the official <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions" target="_blank">&quot;ACM Primary Article Template&quot;</a>. LaTeX users must use \documentclass[sigconf]{acmart}.</li>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="span6">
				<h2>Evaluation Criteria</h2>
				<p>
					The Tutorial committee will review each proposal and will select quality proposals that fit the evaluation criteria. Each proposal will be evaluated based on anticipated benefits for prospective participants in industry and academia and its fit within the program as a whole. Factors to be considered also include relevance, timeliness, importance, and audience appeal; suitability for presentation in the chosen format; effectiveness of teaching methods (especially relevant in the hands-on type); and experience and qualifications of the presenters. Please note that proposals that focus on 
					<ul>
						<li>Very narrow research topics with limited audience appeal</li>
						<li>Commercial presentations that focus on specific tools</li>
						<li>Marketing materials</li>
					</ul>
					are not eligible and will be desk-rejected.
